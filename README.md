# Encryptor
This is a website that encrypts and decrypts input using Cesar Algorithm

## About This Project
I am using this website to encrypt and decrypt messages using Cesar Algorithm. This is a way for me to put my Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge in Javascript to use in my projects.

## What is Cesar Algorithm?
Cesar Algorithm is a simple encryption algorithm that shifts each letter by a certain amount. An example of this is:

```
A -> B
B -> C
C -> D
D -> E
E -> F
F -> G
G -> H
H -> I
I -> J
J -> K
K -> L
L -> M
M -> N
N -> O
O -> P
P -> Q
Q -> R
R -> S
S -> T
T -> U
U -> V
V -> W
W -> X
X -> Y
Y -> Z
Z -> A
```
In this case, the shift is 1. This means that the letter A is now B, B is now C, and so on. The algorithm used to encrypt the message is called a Caesar Cipher. The algorithm is simple and easy to understand however, it is not very secure. It is not recommended to use this algorithm for anything other than testing.

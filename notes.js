My Algorithm for Cesar Cipher:

Encryption:
1. Store first half of the alphabet in string variable
2. Store second half of the alphabet in string variable
3. Extract the message from the input field
4. Convert the message to lowercase
5. Loop through each character in the message
6. If the character is in the first half of the alphabet, replace it with the corresponding letter in the second half of the alphabet
7. If the character is in the second half of the alphabet, replace it with the corresponding letter in the first half of the alphabet
8. If the character is not in the alphabet, leave it as is
9. Display the encrypted message in the output field

This function works both ways.
